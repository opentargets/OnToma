Version 0.0.16:
 - New functions get_mondo_label() and get_hp_label() to retrieve MONDO and HP disease labels using the disease id
 - When the match is found in the HP OBO file the function _find_term_from_string() now returns the actual disease label instead of the one that was queried

 - New function get_efo_from_xref() to map disease ids from other ontologies to EFO using xrefs
Version 0.0.14:
 - Query strings are searched as they are, splitting at commas and semicolons and using the largest substring has been removed.
